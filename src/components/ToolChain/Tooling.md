## Refmt
Line-wrapping AST based formatting is an important feature of 
Reason that integrates with your editing experience. Reason 
includes a powerful, consistent syntax formatter/converter 
called refmt, that can parse, and print the Reason syntax at 
arbitrary width wrappings, while interleaving comments. It 
can also be used to convert between multiple syntaxes.
