# Reason

The Reason reference serves as a repository of facts about the Reason Toolchain. The entirety of reason is described here in detail. As you write Reason code, you'll refer to these pages often. If you're learning Reason, or need help understanding some of its capabilities or features, check out the [Reason guide](/reader/guides/native/anIntroductionToReason/introduction).

The Reason Toolchain is intended to be cross-platform, be it a browser, server-side scripts, native, or similar. For the most part, this reference attempts to be environment-agnostic and does not target any particular environment.

This documentation is broken up into sections. These sections are comprised from:
+ Data Structures
+ Data Types
+ OCaml Standard Library Modules

Each of these sections will contain reference documentation that documents usage and examples of these and functions on these.
